# How I worked on this project

My goal was to create a free AudioBook Mobile Application

- I built this website based off of a Figma Design: [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1148855963126865475)
- I used detailed push commits to describe updates: [Example Commit](https://github.com/SilahicAmil/Read-a-Book/commit/069e9f95dfd339402caf6838e94ec4e5d9f44149)

# How to navigate this project

- File fetching using a custom hook: [Example Code](https://github.com/SilahicAmil/Read-a-Book/blob/main/hooks/useFetchData.js)
- Multiple Navigators Stacks (Tabs/Native Stack): [Example Code](https://github.com/SilahicAmil/Read-a-Book/blob/main/navigation/TabNavigation.js)
- Somewhat complex audio file fetching and audio playing: [Example Code](https://github.com/SilahicAmil/Read-a-Book/blob/main/screens/AudioPlayerScreen.js)
- Unit Testing: [Example Code](https://github.com/SilahicAmil/Read-a-Book)

# Why I built the project this way

- I chose the stack of React Native and Supabase. To really test my knowledge or being able to intergrate mobile and web technologies. Navigation, Data Fetching and Mp3 File Fetching.

- My Plan is to become a Full-Stack Web and Mobile Developer. This project was to test my knowledge of React Native and the core principles of development.

- Testing is another key thing I wanted to focus in on. It's an essential part of production applications and I wanted to treat my application as if it were going to be one. Covering essential features to ensure they work.

# If I had more time I would change this

- Refactor Code
- More testing/end-to-end testing
